# Governance

Meritocracy. The person with more overall contributions will have more influence in the project. This is supposed to be a very simple governance, with the usual open-source roles:

- Maintainer
- Contributor

Any significant contributions made will be properly registered at the [acknowledgments document](./acknowledgments.md).

## A note about the maintenance of the project

> As the original author of the project, I will discontinue all support to TomaRamosApp once I finish my career as Software Engineer at Uandes University. Any engineering Uandes student is welcome to continue the project, at least for updating its courses catalog regularly. You can email me to let me know any questions or suggestions you may have. Thank you.
